The twelve articles in this volume and the introduction developed from talks that were presented at the workshop \textit{Biased Questions: Experimental Results \& Theoretical Modelling} carried out at the Leibniz-Zentrum Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft (ZAS) in Berlin on February 4--5, 2021. This was the third workshop of the project \textit{SPAGAD: Speech Acts in Grammar and Discourse}, funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement no. 787929. Due to the Covid19 epidemic, it had to be carried out as a virtual workshop.

The editors thank Yan Li for help with the preparation of this volume and Sebastian Nordhoff for assistance from the side of Language Science Press.
